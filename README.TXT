This project consists of 2 problems. 
The first proble is a black box function that takes 20 real valued numbers as input. The function
has a unique minimum fitness of 0 for a specific input. The aim was to write a genetic algorithm to find the minimum value. (assumed to be between -5.0 and +5.0)
The second is a version of the knapsack problem. The idea is that you want to
pack a bag. You have 100 items that you would like to take with you. Each item has a utility value
and a weight (assumed to be expressed in kg). You want to maximise your utility (which is the sum
of the utilities of all the items you take with you) but you are not allowed to pack more than 500 kgs
of weight altogether. This means that you need to choose the items that maximise your total utility
while staying within the weight limit.
The aim is to find the combination of items to pack that maximses utility while staying within the weight constraints
